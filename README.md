I'm a software engineer with a passion for making contributing to open source more accessible, creating technology to uplift people and build community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Solidity, ReactJS, and Next. 

My passion in the Blockchian ecosystem and robust smart contract development has led me to commit to open source development around Blockchain.
